# 🧠 Breast Cancer Classification

This project predicts whether a woman has breast cancer or not using medical features. It uses classic machine learning models like Decision Tree and Random Forest to perform binary classification.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- Based on the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html)

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Algorithms Used
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## 🧪 Evaluation
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Train-Test Split

## 📌 Output
The model successfully classifies malignant and benign cases with high accuracy.
